MtDesert:
I reserve only "include" dir & "src" dir, And write a Makefile for compile control.
Depend on CompileScripts, see https://github.com/MtDesert/CompileScripts for more details.

note: this project just for Windows. For Linux we can install glut instead of this, unless you want to change glut's codes while developing.
